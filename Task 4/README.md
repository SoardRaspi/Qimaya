The Jupyter Notebook is my attempt at creating a QML model which tries to predict the sine function. For this, as a novel approach, I have tried to implement the Quantum Residual connection inspired from a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-024-01719-1">research paper</a>. In the target part of the controlled operation connection between the two Hadamard gates, lies the main layers for the variational prediction model. However, due to time constraints, correct implementation of the proposed method could only be done partially.
