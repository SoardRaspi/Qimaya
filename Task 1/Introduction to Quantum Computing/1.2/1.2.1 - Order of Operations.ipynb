    "While programming this circuit, the convention followed is from left-to-right. following the convention, we write the code for the CNOT and RX($\\theta$) gates first. The convention for wire numbering is that the top-most wire starts with the number 0 and then the numbering increments by 1 as we move down the circuit. Then, the Hadamard gate, and so on... The final code for the circuit looks like the following:"
