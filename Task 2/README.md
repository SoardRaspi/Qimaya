<h1>Variational Classifiers</h1>
The Task 2 of the challenge is to learn and apply the concept of Variational Classifier. Variational Classifiers are the quantum version of the ML concept of Supervised Learning.

<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
Supervised Learning is one of the widely used concepts in the field of Machine Learning where the model is provided with a datatset of labeled data. The model trains on a subset of this data and then the other subset of the original dataset is used to evaluate the model.
