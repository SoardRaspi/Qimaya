This is the main project for the QC + AI challenge. Currently the implementation has a generalized function to apply a kernel. The function takes input such as kernel_size, stride and dilation and runs the Quanvolutional Block on the input image. After the Quantum processing, the output is passed onto a classical model, which is a FFN. Here the weights of the variable rotation gates in the Quantum Circuits are updated. Because of time constraints, the complete working implementation of the work could not be done.

A novel idea behind the implementation of the algoriothm for this problem is to use 20 qubits in total to assign amplitudes to each of the $2^20$ states which corresponds to the raw grayscale pixel value. Out of these qubits, 10 are for accessing the x-axis and pther 10 qubits for accessing the y-axis of the image. This novel approach aims at finding relations between each pixel int terms of inter-relation. Again, because of the time and physical device constraints because of other academic commitments, only the image-preprocessing has been done. The image processing is done in such way that for each x value all the values in the column are scaled such that the sum of square of each of the y values for a given x equals to 1. This is to ensure that amplitudes of the individual states out of the $2^29$ states can be easily encoded as the amplitudes.

Given more time, this novel method can be implemented.
